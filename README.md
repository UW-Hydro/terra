TERRA
=====

terra is a library for making attractive and informative geospatial graphics in Python. It is built on top of seaborn and matplotlib, and tightly integrated with the PyData stack, including support for numpy, pandas, and xarray data structures and statistical routines from scipy and statsmodels.

We're just getting started with terra.  For now, get in touch via our github issues page: https://github.com/jhamman/terra/.
